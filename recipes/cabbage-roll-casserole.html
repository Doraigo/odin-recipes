    <h2>An easy and fast recipe with great taste!</h2>
    <p>My cabbage roll casserole has all the ingredients of stuffed cabbage rolls but is a lot easier to make! This
        basic recipe will appeal to everyone but if you prefer more flavor, consider adding crushed garlic, paprika,
        thyme, or cayenne pepper.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>3 Â½ pounds chopped cabbage </li>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and
            crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Combine cabbage, tomato sauce, onion, rice, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in cooked ground beef.
            Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish, then pour beef broth over top.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir, re-cover, and bake until cabbage is tender and rice
            is done, 20 to 30 minutes more. </li>
    </ol>
