    <h2>Square of a pizza slider with melting cheese</h2>
    <p>These sliders really taste like pizza (as they should) but with a hint of sweetness from the Hawaiian rolls.
        Trying to separate them can get messy but they are absolutely delicious.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups (6 oz.) finely pre-shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup (about 3 1/2 oz.) finely pre-shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups pizza sauce (from 1 [13-oz.] jar)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato pesto</li>
        <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian sweet rolls</li>
        <li>¾ cup (about 3 oz.) thinly sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment, and place a
            cooling rack on baking sheet. Spray rack with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Stir together mozzarella, Italian cheese blend, basil, pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Italian seasoning
            in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir together pizza sauce and pesto in another small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Without separating the individual rolls, cut the entire slab of rolls in half horizontally using a serrated
            knife. Place bottom layer of rolls on the prepared baking sheet. Set top layer of rolls aside.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle bottom layer of rolls evenly with half of the cheese mixture; top evenly with half of pepperoni and
            half of the sauce. Repeat layers once.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine butter, Parmesan, garlic powder, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning in a small
            saucepan; cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until butter melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove rolls from oven, and add top layer of rolls; brush top of rolls evenly with butter mixture. Return to
            preheated oven, and bake until rolls are golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Separate the rolls, and
            serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
